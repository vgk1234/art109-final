    <p>We also generated a map that would help us figure out our societyâ€™s future. This map would detect any safe 
    sources of biofuel so we would not end up harming anyone or any place in the process. The idea of using random

    map is generated through AI tech but also monitored to make sure that we can use appropriate ways of generating 
    energy without concerns of destruction of lives.</p>
