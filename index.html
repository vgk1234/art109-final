    <h1>RELOCATION CHRONICLES</h1>
    <p>A while ago, many of us had to relocate due to climate change. We all had many dreams in our lives. 
    Some of us wanted to become scientists, and others wanted to become humanitarians. Just when we thought 
    things would only get better for us, we went through a series of disasters that lasted at least a year or 
    two. One time we went through a hurricane that destroyed several peopleâ€™s homes and caused a lot of 
    flooding. We decided then that was the last straw and officially relocated.</p>
