    <p>Attached to the institution, we also built a biofuel lab for the purpose of research and attempting to make 
    biofuel the source of most of our needs. Since we understood the damage that fossil fuel has caused in our 
    lives, we decided to find an alternative that will help us thrive instead. We obtained the energy we needed 
    from plants in a nearby forest. We are still not completely converted to green energy as the process is not so 
    easy.</p>
